AerE 344 Lab Group 2: Repository for LaTeX Documents

## How to use this Git Repository

This repository is used to compile the final lab report document that we will be using every week for our lab report.
It will prove useful when we need to transfer unformatted versions of our weekly write-ups, and make formatting the entire document much easier. 

How do we use this repository
- Each week we will be writing the corresponding "Sections" of the lab report in blank text over in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ispjlkd0UcwpEjbkI7q04mcrW7IrVjtQ8MenUA1EXEA/edit?ts=5b97d992).
- Joe has volunteered to transfer those sections over weekly, but has given everyone access so they might contribute in the event he is unable to complete the transfer. 
- If you do not know how to use the repository or PuTTy, don't worry about using it, just ask someone else.
- __If you choose to contribute to the LaTeX document using this repository__, please be sure to do a __pull request__ to the MASTER, not main. Joe will approve any requests. 

# This is supposed to make our lives _easier_ not __harder__: if at any point this becomes more effort than it is worth, we will just abandon ship and stick to Hellish Google Docs.
